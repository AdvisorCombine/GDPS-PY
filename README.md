# GDPS-PY
A geometry dash private server emulator written in python

#IMPORTANT

This server is far from complete so don't use it in production. Also before i get yelled on that the code is bad: Its just the beginning to get everything working, when everything will work like intended i will rewrite the parts that are not optimised.
